The Ethereum Credit Guild is the next iteration of what we once knew as Volt Protocol. The goal remains unchanged: to create a credibly neutral and censorship resistant savings and credit system. The mechanism has evolved meaningfully.

Most importantly, this model unifies all minting within a CDP/debt issuance model with ephemeral loan terms that do not rely on an external trusted oracle. Automated systems for borrowing or liquidating must exist on top of this neutral base layer. The system also does not enshrine any trusted external asset or maintain an absolute price peg, in exchange for reducing risk of bank runs and vulnerability to fluctuations in trusted collateral pricing.
